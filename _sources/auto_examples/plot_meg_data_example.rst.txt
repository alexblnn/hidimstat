        (target) and the preprocessed gain matrix (design matrix). This function
        is mainly wrapping the `_prepare_gain` MNE function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        evoked : instance of mne.Evoked
            The evoked data.

        forward : instance of Forward
            The forward solution.

        noise_cov : instance of Covariance
            The noise covariance.

        loose : float in [0, 1] or 'auto'
            Value that weights the source variances of the dipole components
            that are parallel (tangential) to the cortical surface. If loose
            is 0 then the solution is computed with fixed orientation.
            If loose is 1, it corresponds to free orientations.
            The default value ('auto') is set to 0.2 for surface-oriented source
            space and set to 1.0 for volumic or discrete source space.

        depth : None or float in [0, 1]
            Depth weighting coefficients. If None, no depth weighting is performed.

        pca : bool, optional (default=False)
            If True, Whitener is reduced.
            If False, Whitener is not reduced.

        rank : None or int
            Rank reduction of the whitener. If None rank is estimated from data.

        Returns
        -------
        G : array, shape (n_channels, n_dipoles)
            The preprocessed gain matrix.

        M : array, shape (n_channels, n_times)
            The whitened MEG/EEG measurements.

        forward : instance of Forward
            The preprocessed forward solution.
