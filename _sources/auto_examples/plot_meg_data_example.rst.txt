Support recovery on MEG data
============================

This example compares several methods that recover the support in the MEG/EEG
source localization problem with statistical guarantees. Here we work
with two datasets that study three different tasks (visual, audio, somato).

We reproduce the real data experiment of Chevalier et al. (2020) [1]_,
which shows the benefit of (ensemble) clustered inference such as
(ensemble of) clustered desparsified Multi-Task Lasso ((e)cd-MTLasso)
over standard approach such as sLORETA. Specifically, it retrieves
the support using a natural threshold (not computed a posteriori)
of the estimated parameter. The estimated support enjoys statistical
guarantees.

Specific preprocessing functions

The functions below are used to load or preprocess the data or to put
the solution in a convenient format. If you are reading this example

        Parameters
        ----------
        evoked : instance of mne.Evoked
            The evoked data.

        forward : instance of Forward
            The forward solution.

        noise_cov : instance of Covariance
            The noise covariance.

        loose : float in [0, 1] or 'auto'
            Value that weights the source variances of the dipole components
            that are parallel (tangential) to the cortical surface. If loose
            is 0 then the solution is computed with fixed orientation.
            If loose is 1, it corresponds to free orientations.
            The default value ('auto') is set to 0.2 for surface-oriented source
            space and set to 1.0 for volumic or discrete source space.
            See for details:
            https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/inverse/35_dipole_orientations.html?highlight=loose

        depth : None or float in [0, 1]
            Depth weighting coefficients. If None, no depth weighting is performed.

        pca : bool, optional (default=False)
            If True, whitener is reduced.
            If False, whitener is not reduced (square matrix).

        Returns
        -------
        G : array, shape (n_channels, n_dipoles)
            The preprocessed gain matrix. If pca=True then n_channels is
            effectively equal to the rank of the data.

        M : array, shape (n_channels, n_times)
            The whitened MEG/EEG measurements. If pca=True then n_channels is
            effectively equal to the rank of the data.

        forward : instance of Forward
            The preprocessed forward solution.

Preparing data for clustered inference
--------------------------------------

For clustered inference we need the targets ``Y``, the design matrix ``X``
and the ``connectivity`` matrix, which is a sparse adjacency matrix.

Running clustered inference
---------------------------

For MEG data ``n_clusters = 1000`` is generally a good default choice.
Taking ``n_clusters > 2000`` might lead to an unpowerful inference.
Taking ``n_clusters < 500`` might compress too much the data leading
to a compressed problem not close enough to the original problem.

Analysis of the results
-----------------------
While the clustered inference solution always highlights the expected
cortex (audio, visual or somato-sensory) with a universal predertemined
threshold, the solution derived from the sLORETA method does not enjoy
the same property. For the audio task the method is conservative and
for the somato task the method makes false discoveries (then it seems
anti-conservative).
